# RandomImage
Extremely simple random image generator.

This was programmed as an attempt to learn some of Rust's basic features.

An executable can be made by pulling the project and the running

```cargo build --release```

at which point RandomImage.exe can be located in target\release. 

Run the program with 

```RandomImage.exe <width> <height>```

with width and height having default values of 1920 and 1080 respecitvely.
